## `tgl`

### Description
> :memo: The action keyword lists:
>    1. the result(s) to start a new time entry,
>    2. past time entries that fuzzy match the current input, and
>    3. all currently executable plugin commands.

#### `tgl` with no further input
When the plugin is triggered with no further input, the list of results will contain:
1. `Start an empty time entry now`,
2. `Start an empty time entry [x time] ago at previous stop time`, and
3. A list of currently executable commands.

> **Note**  
> The `previous stop time` action is only available if:
> 1. There is a past time entry, and
> 2. There is no currently running time entry.

> **Note**  
> Relevant `Usage Tip`s will also be displayed if `Show Usage Results: Tips` is enabled in the plugin settings.

#### `tgl [command name]`
When followed by a recognised command name, the respective command will be auto-triggered and the list of results will contain its respective actions.

![`tgl` with a command name](assets/screenshots/tgl/command-name.png)

> **Note**  
> To create a new time entry that starts with a command name, you may escape the command with a backslash (`\`) character.  
> ![`tgl` with an escaped command name](assets/screenshots/tgl/escaped-command-name.png)

#### `tgl ...`
When followed by anything other than a command name, the list of results will contain:
1. `Start ... now`,
2. `Start ... [x time] ago at previous stop time`,
3. A list of past time entries whose descriptions fuzzy match the `...` query, and
4. A list of currently executable commands that fuzzy match the `...` query.

> **Note**  
> The `previous stop time` action is only available if:
> 1. There is a past time entry, and
> 2. There is no currently running time entry.

> **Note**  
> Relevant `Usage Tip`s will also be displayed if `Show Usage Results: Tips` is enabled in the plugin settings.

### Usage Examples
- `tgl`
- `tgl stop`

- `tgl reports`

---

## `tgl start`

### Description
> :memo: Start a new time entry.

> **Note**  
> This command exists at the top-level and does not have a command (ie no `tgl start`).

### Usage Examples
- `tgl`
- `tgl new time entry`
- `tgl @[project]`
- `tgl new time entry@[project]`
- `tgl Release v1.2.1 -t -10`
- `tgl New time entry -t 30s @[project]`

### Symbols, Flags, and Key Modifiers
| Name                     | Symbol | Description                          | Example              |
| ------------------------ | ------ | ------------------------------------ | -------------------- |
| Project Selection Prefix | `@`    | Set a project for the new time entry | `@flow-toggl-plugin` |

| Name      | Flag | Description                                                               | Example          |
| --------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Time Span | `-t` | Offset the starting time of the new time entry with a specified time span | `-t -30 seconds` |

| Name                               | Key Modifier | Description                                                                   | Example                                           |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Quick-Start from Project Selection | `Alt`        | Instantly start the new time entry directly from the project selection screen | `tgl Release v4.0.0@flow-toggl` > `Alt` + `Enter` |

### Notes and Warnings
> **Note**  
> 1. Any currently running time entry will first be stopped before starting the new time entry to prevent overlapping entries (mimics Toggl Track behaviour)
> 2. If a time entry is not currently running, there will be an option to start the new time entry at the previous stop time (if one exists).
> 3. To include a command symbol/flag in your time entry description, you can escape it with a backslash (`\`), eg `tgl Email james\@jamesnzl.xyz \-t -t -5`

> **Warning**  
> 1. The `Time Span` flag must be the entered after the time entry description. Anything entered after the `-t` flag will be ignored.
> 2. Due to a current [Flow Launcher bug](https://github.com/Flow-Launcher/Flow.Launcher/issues/2191), the `Alt` quick-start will execute if you use the `Alt` + `number` hotkey to select a project. This can be circumvented for the time being by changing your `Open Result Modifier Key` to `Ctrl` in the Flow `Hotkey` settings.

| Clear Description | `-C` | Empty the time entry description from the Flow search bar                      | `-C`             |

### Notes and Warnings
> **Note**  
> 1. If an `End Time Span` is specified, the time entry will be stopped (if it is currently running).
> 2. The `Clear Description` flag will only empty the time entry description from the Flow search bar, so a replacement can be input quickly.
>    > **Note**  
>    > To actually clear a time entry's description, use the `Clear Description` flag then hit the `Enter` action key to save.
> 3. `tgl edit` will use the entered description to perform a fuzzy match against all previously tracked time entries (within the past 12 months), allowing you to quickly apply a previous time entry's description/project/etc.
> 4. To include a command symbol/flag in your time entry description, you can escape it with a backslash (`\`), eg `tgl edit Email james\@jamesnzl.xyz \-t \-T \-C`

> **Warning**  
> 1. The `Time Span`/`End Time Span` flags must be the entered after the time entry description. Anything entered after the flag(s) will be ignored.
> 2. The list of editable time entries will only contain up to `1000` of the most-recent time entries due to Toggl limitations.

## `tgl browser`

### Description
> :memo: Open the [Toggl Track](https://track.toggl.com/timer) website in a browser.

- `tgl browser`

---

## `tgl help`

### Description

## `tgl refresh`

>    1. Project names/colours/clients,
>    2. Client names,
>    3. Reports time zone, and
>    4. First day of the week.
